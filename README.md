## About

The main idea of our project is to use fundamental as well as technical analysis using fundamental data (Source: News Articles from Finviz as well as Twitter Posts using Tweepy and sntwitter) as well as technical analysis (Source: Stock Prices Data from YahooFinance) in order to combine features from news headlines, Twitter posts as well as historical data to predict the future price of a stock of interest. We have prepared a prototype in order to demonstrate the future prices for next quarter.
